## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass(SCSS)
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- VS Code

### What I learned
- need to understand SVG & pseudo elements better
- I loved working on the accordion and tabs parts, they were really challanging

### Continued development

- learning more about regex and find a shorter solution for email validation
- lear more about automatically adjust web design
